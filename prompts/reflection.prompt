Analyze the execution result and update the agent's internal understanding.

Goal: {{GOAL}}
Action Taken: {{ACTION}}
Execution Result: {{RESULT}}

Reflect on:
- Was the action successful? What was the exact outcome?
- Did it bring us closer to the goal? By how much?
- Are there errors, unexpected behaviors, or side effects?
- What is the most logical next step?
- Is there evidence of stagnation (same failure repeating)?

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT suggest rewriting unrelated modules.
- Do NOT suggest overly complex recovery plans. Propose the simplest fix first.
- If the same error has occurred more than once, propose a fundamentally different approach.

Output ONLY valid JSON:
