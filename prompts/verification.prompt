Verify the success of the execution against the stated goal.

Goal: {{GOAL}}
Action Taken: {{ACTION}}
Execution Result: {{RESULT}}

Verification criteria:
- Did the action achieve its intended outcome?
- Is the system state consistent with the expected outcome?
- Are there any side effects or errors?
- Is the OVERALL goal fully completed, or are further steps required?

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT mark status as "success" unless the output explicitly confirms the intended outcome.
- Do NOT hallucinate verification. If the output is ambiguous, mark status as "partial".
- If the goal requires multiple steps, mark status as "partial" until ALL steps are verified.

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "status": "success|failed|partial",
  "content": "<summary of what was verified>",
  "error": "<technical cause if failed, empty string if success>",
  "verified": true|false,
  "goal_complete": true|false,
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of the verification decision>"
}
